## Hi, I'm Tom 👋

I live in Germany 🇩🇪 working as a software developer at [Tiplu](https://tiplu.de/).

### I'm interested in...

💡 [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) for my smart home (also see my blog at [https://vigonotion.com](https://vigonotion.com) which is mainly about smarthome)
  - https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.stadtreinigung_hamburg
  - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hvv_departures/
  
🚍 API libraries for the city I live in (Hamburg). I actually use them mostly for Home Assistant.

🤖 Other stuff I'm interested in

🛠 Soldering things that help me around my house (again for use with Home Assistant :D)

### After a long day...
I'd like to say 
> [Alexa, cinema mode](https://vigonotion.com/blog/building-a-smart-home-theater-with-home-assistant/)
and watch some shows. Here are my top recommendations for you:

🤠 Westworld

🌳 Dark

🧬 Orphan Black
