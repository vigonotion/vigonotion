### Hi, I'm Tom Schneider 👋

I'm a student at [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/) and live in Germany 🇩🇪. When I'm not studying I'm working as a student employee programmer at [Tiplu](https://tiplu.de/) or playing around with these:

- 💡 [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) for my smart home (also see my blog at [https://vigonotion.com](https://vigonotion.com) which is mainly about smarthome)
  - https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.stadtreinigung_hamburg
  - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hvv_departures/
- 🚍 API libraries for the city I live in (Hamburg). I actually use them mostly for Home Assistant.

  - https://github.com/vigonotion/baustellen_hamburg
- 🤖 Other stuff I'm interested in
  - https://github.com/vigonotion/telegram-mensa-bot
- 🛠 Soldering things that help me around my house (again for use with Home Assistant :D)

### After a long day...
I'd like to say 
> [Alexa, cinema mode](https://vigonotion.com/blog/building-a-smart-home-theater-with-home-assistant/)
and watch some shows. Here are my top recommendations for you:

1. 🌳 Dark
2. 🧬 Orphan Black
3. 🕓 Travelers
